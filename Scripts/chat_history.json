    "Previous conversation summary",
    "The user initially stated they didn't need further assistance but then asked for an overview of their `LinkedList` code. CodeOn provided an explanation of the `Node` class, `LinkedList` class (including `__init__`, `insert`, `delete`, `update`, and `display` methods), and the `main` function for user interaction. The user then asked what the code did, and CodeOn detailed the functionality of the linear search algorithm, highlighting the initial unused input and unreachable print statements. The user thanked CodeOn, and CodeOn detailed the functions and their parameters in the code."
